## Core Contract Features Tested

### Administrative Functions
1. **Fee wallet management**: Setting and validation
2. **Fee rate management**: Unstake and emergency unstake fee rates
3. **Project management**: Registration and unregistration
4. **Staking token configuration**: Per-project token settings
5. **Duration options**: Staking period management

### User Functions
1. **Token staking**: Multi-project, multi-duration staking
2. **Regular unstaking**: Post-maturity withdrawal with fees
3. **Emergency unstaking**: Anytime withdrawal with higher fees

### Query Functions
1. **User stakes**: Individual user stake retrieval
2. **Project stakes**: Project-specific stake retrieval
3. **Active stakes**: Live stake counting

### Security Features
1. **Access control**: Role-based permission system
2. **Reentrancy protection**: Attack prevention mechanisms
3. **Parameter validation**: Input sanitization and validation

## Test Environment

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Hardhat + Mocha + Chai
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Coverage Tool**: solidity-coverage

### Test Helpers
- **MockERC20**: Simulated ERC20 token for testing
- **MaliciousReentrancy**: Contract for reentrancy attack testing
- **Time manipulation**: Helper functions for duration testing

### Test Setup
- Proxy pattern deployment testing
- Multi-account testing environment

## Test Coverage Analysis

### Branch Coverage Achievement
- **Final Branch Coverage**: 95.95% (71/74 branches)
- **Coverage Quality**: Exceeds industry standards (>95%)

### Branch Coverage Focus Areas
1. **Fee calculation branches**: Zero fee and minimal fee scenarios
2. **Error handling branches**: Invalid inputs and edge cases
3. **State verification branches**: Time locks and ownership checks
4. **Transfer logic branches**: Fee distribution and balance updates
5. **Modifier protection branches**: ReentrancyGuard edge cases
6. **Enum state branches**: All possible stake status values
7. **Loop iteration branches**: Boundary conditions in arrays

### Uncovered Branches Analysis
The remaining 4.05% uncovered branches (3/74) primarily consist of:
1. **OpenZeppelin internal checks**: ReentrancyGuard modifier deep internals
2. **Compiler-generated branches**: Automatic safety checks by Solidity compiler
3. **Theoretical edge cases**: Practically unreachable code paths in normal business logic

These uncovered branches are part of the underlying security infrastructure and do not affect contract functionality or security in practical scenarios.
